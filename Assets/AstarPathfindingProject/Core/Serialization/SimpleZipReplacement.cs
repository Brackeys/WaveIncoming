//#define ASTAR_NO_ZIP //Enable to strip out usage of the DotNetZip library. Increases serialized data size, but this is only relevant if you are using cached startup or loading serialized graphs during runtime. You can delete the Pathfinding.Ionic.Zip.Reduced dll after you have enabled this. You will have to reconfigure all graph settings after enabling.
